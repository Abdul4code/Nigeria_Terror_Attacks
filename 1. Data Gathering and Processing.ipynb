    "Nigeria is one of such countries of the world where insecurity and terrorist activities has been on the rise. The West African nation is one of the most hazardous nations in the world, with the most frequent and deadly attacks. There have been 2470 terrorist incidents in the last five years, resulting in 17751 fatalities and 7345 injuries (WorldData.info). With the emergence of new dangerous groups like the Fulani extremists and herdsmen, these numbers continue to rise daily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attacks in Nigeria have the notable characteristic that each terrorist group or sect's attacks can almost immediately be linked to them due to similarities in the attack's mode, target, duration, motive, and casualty toll, among other factors. It can be argued that patterns and intelligence can be extracted from datasets of these attacks. Even if these records are accessible in public places like Wikipedia, social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, news websites, and newspapers, to name a few, they aren't offered in formats that are simple to use with tools for data manipulation and analysis. Consequently, limiting the utilizing of data-centric approach in combating terrorism in the nation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This furthers the project's motivation. To aid in the fight against insecurity, the project aims to collect data about attacks and security incidences in Nigeria, process the data into a widely used format, perform analysis on the dataset to identify trends and patterns, and provide answers to questions about the mode of operation, timing, motive, and other aspects of the attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the project's main focus is on insecurity in Nigeria, it has worldwide significance because terrorism has always been a problem on a global scale. While it is true that this threat's exposure differs from region to region and country to country, the necessity of taking effective action on a global scale cannot be overstated."
